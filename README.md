# NixOS configuration

### Installation
Clone this repository and then copy and paste your `hardware-configuration.nix` to one of the host listed in `hosts` folder here.
Build with this command `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake ./#HOSTNAME` (replace HOSTNAME with one of the hosts).<br>
When done building, run `matugen image ~/Pictures/Wallpapers/WALLPAPER_NUMBER`.

Home manager doesn't get installed when building, i will fix this later.
